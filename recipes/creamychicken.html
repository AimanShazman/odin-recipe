        <p>This creamy garlic chicken is ready in about 30 minutes. It's good enough to serve company, 
            but it's also one of those dishes that works for a quick weeknight dinner. A lovely reader 
            said that it's "one of the best things I have ever eaten!!!" It was an early hit on the blog 
            and actually shaped the direction of S&L towards easy comfort food.</p>
